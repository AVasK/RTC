## Ray-Tracing Core
---------------------
Prototyping ray-tracer with iteratve ray-marching
in Python.

(+) can handle really complex meshes given as math functions

(+) easily prototyped

(-) not really effective because of iterative nature

(?) possibly it'll be re-written in Haskell... upd.: Possibly not :)
